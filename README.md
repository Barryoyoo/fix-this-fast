## 🧩 The Code

Inside this repo, you'll find broken calculator implementations in multiple languages:

- 🐍 Python: `python/broken_calculator.py`
- ☕ Java: `Java/BrokenCalculator.java`
- 💻 JavaScript: `Javascript/broken_calculator.js`
- 🔷 C#: `Csharp/BrokenCalculator.cs`

Each implementation contains similar types of bugs for you to fix, including:
- Syntax errors

## 🛠️ How to Get Started

### 🔄 Fork the Repository
1. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right of this repo to create your own copy
2. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account

### 💻 Clone Your Fork
1. Open your terminal or Git Bash
2. Clone your forked repository (not the original):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fix-this-fast.git
cd fix-this-fast
```

### 🌿 Create Your Solution Branch
1. Create a new branch for your solution:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/LANGUAGE-NAME-solution  # Example: fix/python-solution
```
2. This creates a separate branch for your work, keeping the main branch clean
3. You can create multiple branches for different language solutions

### � Test Your Fixes

#### Python
```bash
cd python
python -m unittest test_calculator.py
```

#### Java
```bash
cd Java
javac BrokenCalculator.java
java BrokenCalculator
```

#### JavaScript
```bash
cd Javascript
node broken_calculator.js
```

#### C#
```bash
cd Csharp
dotnet run BrokenCalculator.cs
```

### ✅ Commit Your Fix
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed calculator bugs in [language]"
git push origin team-yourteamname

```

### 🚀 Submit Your Solution via Pull Request

1. Push your solution branch to your fork:
```bash
git push origin fix/LANGUAGE-NAME-solution
```

2. Go to your fork on GitHub
3. Click the "Compare & pull request" button that appears
4. Set up the pull request:
   - base repository: `Debug-Jeff/fix-this-fast`
   - base: `main`
   - head repository: `YOUR-USERNAME/fix-this-fast`
   - compare: `fix/LANGUAGE-NAME-solution`

5. Fill in the pull request details:
   - Title: "Fix calculator bugs in [LANGUAGE]"
   - Description: 
     - List the bugs you fixed
